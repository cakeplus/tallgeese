**Tallgeese** is an `OCaml/C/Objective-C` based GUI for ssh. It is just
 for `OS X`

Working version that actually connects and works:

# Issues (There are many)

1.  Everything is sync, async will come later
2.  Only authenticating if you already have ssh keys known for a
    particular host
3.  I'm doing this completely without XCode, InterfaceBuilder so some
    things are somewhat harder to do or take me longer to figure
    out; `Cocoa` does a lot of magic.

Question: Where did the name come from?
